# Challenge

The robotics software ecosystem today is **fragmented and complex**.  
Developers often face limitations in:  
- AI / reinforcement learning  
- Rendering & visualization  
- Kinematics & planning  
- Sensor data integration  

ROBA solves this by creating a single platform that combines all these needs.
